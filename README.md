## 👋 Hi, I’m Adi Narayana Madapakula

**Senior AI/ML Engineer | GenAI & ML Systems | Databricks Certified GenAI Professional**

I’m a Senior AI/ML Engineer with ~4 years of experience building, deploying, and operating **production-grade Machine Learning and Generative AI systems**. I specialize in **end-to-end ML system ownership** — from problem formulation and data pipelines to model deployment, monitoring, and scale.

My work spans **classical ML, time-series forecasting, optimization, NLP, LLMs, RAG pipelines, and MLOps**, with a strong foundation in **software engineering and cloud-native architectures**. I focus on building **reliable, scalable, and business-impacting AI systems**, not just models.
